 Homepage Redesign Proposal for Stan The Handyman

This proposal presents a detailed vision for the homepage redesign of Stan The Handyman, a trusted local home repair and renovation business. The objective is to modernize the homepage design, improve its visual and structural clarity, and enhance overall usability—while keeping the existing color palette, structure, and brand identity intact. The redesign will deliver a clean, professional, and approachable look that feels warm, credible, and trustworthy to local homeowners.

The final deliverable will be a fully responsive Figma file, designed for both desktop and mobile layouts, ready for developer handoff. The new homepage will elevate the digital presence of Stan The Handyman by combining design refinement, visual balance, and clear user flow—all while retaining the friendly, reliable personality that customers already associate with the brand.

1. Understanding the Objective

Stan The Handyman has built its reputation on reliability, skill, and personable service. However, the existing homepage layout and style need a visual update to match current design standards and user expectations. The goal of this redesign is not to reinvent the brand, but to evolve it—keeping the same colors, logo, and structure while enhancing visual appeal, content flow, and interaction clarity.

The new design will preserve the recognizable red, white, and black palette, while introducing better typography hierarchy, refined layouts, and modern spacing for a more polished appearance. The homepage will look both trustworthy and professional, resonating with the needs of local homeowners seeking dependable repair and renovation services.

This project focuses on a single page—the homepage—but its design direction will be strong enough to serve as the foundation for future pages if the brand expands later.

2. Design Vision and Approach

The new homepage will combine visual clarity with user-centered design principles. Every section will be carefully balanced to guide the visitor’s attention naturally—from discovering who Stan is, to learning about his services, to finally requesting a free estimate.

The design will embody three main characteristics:

Clean and Professional: Simple, spacious layouts that emphasize content clarity.

Approachable and Local: Friendly photography, authentic testimonials, and community-oriented tone.

Trustworthy and Action-Oriented: Clear calls to action and easy access to service requests.

This approach ensures that visitors not only enjoy browsing but also feel confident in taking the next step to contact Stan for their home projects.

3. Redesigning the Existing Sections

The homepage will maintain its existing structure but receive a complete visual overhaul for better alignment, readability, and flow.

a. Hero Section

The hero banner will establish a stronger visual hierarchy. A bold, clear headline will communicate Stan’s core value proposition (“Reliable Home Repairs and Renovations You Can Trust”) with a prominent call-to-action button (“Request Free Estimate”) immediately visible.

A relevant background photo—either of Stan at work or a well-renovated home—will give an authentic, relatable touch. The use of color contrast and clean typography will ensure that the section captures attention instantly.

b. About Section

This section is about personality and authenticity. Stan’s existing photo and text will remain but be restructured into a visually engaging layout—for example, a left-aligned image with right-aligned text in an open, white space layout.

Small design enhancements such as icons or background accents will subtly highlight Stan’s years of experience, dedication, and customer-first approach.

c. Services Grid (Six Service Cards)

The “Our Services” section will feature six service cards laid out in a modern, consistent grid system. Each card will contain a small icon or image, service name, and a brief description.

Hover effects (for desktop) will add interactivity, while mobile versions will be optimized for touch navigation. The cards will be visually unified to improve scannability and visual balance.

d. Projects Gallery

The “Our Projects” gallery will be redesigned with a modern image grid or carousel format. This section will showcase before-and-after visuals or completed jobs, highlighting Stan’s craftsmanship and versatility.

Captions or short descriptions can be added for better context. A lightbox or zoom effect can enhance the browsing experience.

e. Request Free Estimate

This section is the conversion point of the page and will receive special attention. A simplified, visually clean form will replace the current version. The call-to-action button will be large, clear, and prominently colored in the brand’s signature red.

Subtext such as “No obligation, just a free quote” will add reassurance. A contrasting background (like a light gray or subtle pattern) will visually separate the section from the rest of the page.

f. Footer

The footer will maintain the same content structure but adopt a more refined layout. It will include clear links, contact information, a small logo, and possibly icons for social media or certifications.

Whitespace and font consistency will make it cleaner and more readable.

4. Adding Two New Sections

The new homepage will include two additional sections that strengthen the business’s credibility and engagement:

a. Reviews / Testimonials

This section will feature 3–5 authentic customer testimonials, including star ratings and short review snippets. Each testimonial card will have a subtle border, clean typography, and optional customer names or initials.

This section enhances trust by providing social proof, one of the most important conversion tools for local service businesses. It assures visitors that Stan is reliable, professional, and well-reviewed by real clients.

b. Blog Roll

The new Blog Roll section will preview the latest three blog posts, each showing a small thumbnail image, a headline, a short summary, and a “Read More” button.

This section will make the homepage more dynamic and help position Stan as an expert in his field—offering practical home maintenance tips, renovation advice, and seasonal repair ideas. It also adds long-term SEO benefits by linking to fresh content.

5. Design Execution and Technical Details

The entire redesign will be created in Figma, following a clean, organized workflow for easy developer handoff. All components—such as buttons, icons, and text styles—will be standardized to maintain visual consistency.

Both desktop and mobile versions will be included, ensuring the design is fully responsive. Typography and spacing will follow a clear modular grid to maintain visual rhythm.

Accessibility and usability best practices will be implemented, including color contrast optimization, readable font sizes, and intuitive interaction cues. The final layout will be easy to maintain and expand in the future.

6. Deliverables

A Figma file of the redesigned homepage (desktop and mobile versions).

Defined style guide (colors, fonts, spacing, button styles).

Layered components for easy developer handoff.

Interaction notes for hover states, buttons, and responsive adjustments.

7. Why This Redesign Works

This redesign perfectly balances modernization with brand preservation. It keeps the core identity of Stan The Handyman intact—same colors, same friendly tone—but introduces better structure, consistency, and emotional connection.

By improving hierarchy, typography, and usability, the new homepage will make it easier for visitors to find what they need and contact Stan with confidence. Testimonials and blog content will build credibility and engagement, while responsive design ensures a seamless experience across all devices.

Ultimately, this homepage redesign is about trust, clarity, and conversion—helping Stan continue to grow as the go-to handyman for local homeowners.
